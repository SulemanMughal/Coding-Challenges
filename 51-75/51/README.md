# Challenge No. 51

Write a recursive function that will return the longest word in a sentence. In cases where more than one word is found, return the first one.

**Examples**

    find_longest("I will and ever will be gratefully and perpetually loving you Tesh!") ➞ "perpetually"
     
    find_longest("A thing of beauty is a joy forever.") ➞ "forever"
     
    find_longest("Forgetfulness is by all means powerless!") ➞ "forgetfulness"
     
    find_longest("\"Strengths\" is the longest and most commonly used word that contains only a single vowel.") ➞ "strengths"

**Notes**

-   Special characters and symbols don't count as part of the word.

-   Return the longest word found in lowercase letters.

-   You are expected to solve this challenge via a recursive approach.
